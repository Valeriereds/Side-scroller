# JumpIt NYC

## Descriptions

Our side-scrolling single-level javascript game, JumpIt NYC, was made through a wonderfully seamless, collaborative effort. Our game started out with only a sprite-sheet attached to it's assets folder, and a dream attached to our hearts. But with a team willing to put in the work over a straight week, we built our game from scratch, debugging every syntax issue that came across our path. We started out with creating and fleshing out the game's database models for the User and Scores, defining the relationships between them, and tackling the routes to retrieve and post our user's data input. The toughest part of the whole endeavor was by far making and testing our routes. Many, many times it was syntax, but going over our code step-by-step helped our team figure out what we might have missed. Our second biggest issue turned into linking each handlebar page to it's appropriate fetch request, making sure the button was redirecting properly on the front end, as well as only letting the authorized user(one who's logged in) go past the initial log in page. Using the WithAuth middleware, the application prevents anyone who's not logged in to access any secure pages, so it was a no-brainer using it for our routes. Last, but absolutely not least in the slightest, we had to build a functional, 80's era inspired, pixelated, side-scrolling game! One brave member of our team tackled this hurdle solo, and blew way past our beginner expectations, while also learning how to use canvas, as this was the starting point in creating our game. He referenced the Frank's Laboratory tutorial throughout development of this game, which helped pave the way for him to not only build a working game, but include a few extra features as well! Adding gameplay music, power-up and game-over sound effects, plus the functionality of the power-up itself, really pushed this game to the next level. Not only can you dodge an attack, now you can earn double the points as well! Our last issue was making sure our leaderboard handlebar page displayed the User name and score in a descending order. We referenced past class activities, as well as the documentation, to find our solution. Which turned out to be incorrect syntax, our toughest enemy. This was our team's first effort with making a game, and we hope you enjoy it playing it as much as we enjoyed watching our work come to life!

Future improvements include: 
- Choose a character from various sprites and save it to user profile
- Game can end without player failure (introduce a running clock to get to the end of the level)
- Use the y-axis for obstacles/enemies as well (swimming or flying enemies)
- Other power-up options: fighting enemies with fireballs
- Add more sophisticated game stats for leaderboard differentiation
- Fight a boss at the level's end
- Add more than 1 level

## Installation

No installation is necessary to play JumpIt NYC from its deployed location! 

To host JumpIt NYC locally, once the gitHub repository has been cloned, open the integrated node terminal to download all included node packages in the project's package.json file by running the `npm i` command. Lastly, run node server.js and open your browser to the https://localhost3001/ to play!

## Database Creation & Seeding

We created our interrelational database with two tables for scoring user's credentials and scores.

Although no seeding of the database is necessary to play and enjoy JumpIt NYC, seeding and modeling files were included in the project for testing purposes, and can be accessed by users who create a .env file locally  and input their mysql credentials. Users should also run the `SOURCE db/schema.sql;` command once mysql has been opened in the terminal to initially drop and create anew the sidescroller database. 

## Usage



To access the game, an existing user must be logged in, otherwise a new user must sign up, using a password that must be 8 or more characters. When the user is logged in, they're redirected to a homepage with three options: Start Game, access Leaderboards, or Log Out, as well on the following instructions on how to play the game: hit the left or right arrow keys to move your character around the game screen, as well as jumping up to dodge rats and acquire pizza power-ups for double the points! Once a player loses, they are redirected to the game over screen, which allows them to restart the game, look at the leaderboards, or log out and let another player try their hand at beating your score! Only the top 5 highest scores are displayed on the leaderboards, good luck!
