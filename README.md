# Side-scroller

## Descriptions

Future improvements: 
- Add music
- Choose a character from various sprites and save it to useful profile
- Game can end without player failure (introduce a running clock to get to the end of the level)
- Use the y-axis for obstacles/enemies as well (swimming or flying enemies)
- Other powerup options: fighting enemies with fireballs
- Log more game stats for leaderboard differentiation and database complexity
- Fight a boss at the level's end
